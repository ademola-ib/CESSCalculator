## Welcome to CESSCalculator

CESSCalculator is a civil engineering structural analysis tool designed for slope-deflection analysis of beams and frames.

## Creating Your First Project

1. **Navigate to the Dashboard** - From the home screen, you'll see options for Beam and Frame analysis
2. **Choose Analysis Type** - Select either:
   - **Beam Analysis** - For single or multi-span beams
   - **Frame Analysis** - For rigid frame structures
3. **Enter Project Data** - Fill in the geometry, material properties, and loading conditions
4. **View Results** - Switch to the Results tab to see reactions, diagrams, and analysis output

## Project Management

### Saving Projects

Projects are automatically saved to your browser's local storage as you work. Click "Save Project" to persist your changes.

### Renaming Projects

1. Go to **History** in the bottom navigation
2. Click the edit icon next to your project name
3. Enter a new name and click Save

### Duplicating Projects

To create a copy of an existing project:
1. Navigate to **History**
2. Click the duplicate icon next to the project
3. A copy will be created with "(Copy)" appended to the name

### Deleting Projects

**Warning:** Deletion is permanent and cannot be undone.

1. Go to **History**
2. Click the trash icon next to the project
3. Confirm the deletion

## Navigation

The app uses a bottom navigation bar with four sections:

- **Home** - Dashboard with quick access to create new projects
- **History** - View and manage all saved projects
- **Manual** - Documentation and guides (you are here!)
- **Settings** - App preferences and data management

## Tips for Success

- **Start Simple** - Begin with a single-span beam to familiarize yourself with the interface
- **Save Often** - Use the Save button frequently to prevent data loss
- **Check Units** - Ensure consistent units throughout your input (meters, kN, kN·m²)
- **Review Results** - Always verify that the calculated reactions and diagrams make physical sense

## Need Help?

If you encounter issues or have questions:
- Review the manual sections for detailed guidance
- Check that all required fields are filled in correctly
- Ensure numerical values are valid (positive where required)
