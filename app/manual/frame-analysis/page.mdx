## Frame Analysis Overview

The frame analysis module handles multi-bay, multi-storey rigid frame structures using slope-deflection equations with joint compatibility and equilibrium.

## Input Parameters

### Frame Geometry

**Number of Bays**
- Horizontal divisions in the frame
- Range: 1 to 5 bays
- Each bay can have equal or custom width

**Number of Stories**
- Vertical divisions in the frame
- Range: 1 to 5 stories
- Each story can have equal or custom height

**Bay Width (m)**
- Horizontal distance between columns
- Must be positive
- Example: 6.0 meters

**Story Height (m)**
- Vertical distance between floors
- Must be positive
- Example: 4.0 meters

### Member Properties

**Column EI (kN·m²)**
- Flexural rigidity of vertical members
- Typically stiffer than beams for lateral stability
- Example: 80000 kN·m²

**Beam EI (kN·m²)**
- Flexural rigidity of horizontal members
- Must be positive
- Example: 60000 kN·m²

## Analysis Method

The solver uses the **slope-deflection method** which:

1. Expresses member end moments in terms of rotations and deflections
2. Enforces equilibrium at each joint
3. Enforces compatibility (continuous rotations/displacements)
4. Solves the resulting system of equations
5. Back-calculates member forces from the displacement solution

## Results Interpretation

### Joint Displacements

Shows the calculated displacements and rotations at each node:

- **Δx (mm)** - Horizontal displacement
- **Δy (mm)** - Vertical displacement (negative is downward)
- **θ (rad)** - Joint rotation (small angle approximation)

### Member Forces

For each member, the results include:

- **Axial Force** - Tension/compression in the member
- **Shear Force** - Transverse force
- **Bending Moment** - End moments from slope-deflection equations

### Support Reactions

Vertical and horizontal reactions at fixed/pinned supports. Verify equilibrium:
- Sum of horizontal reactions = horizontal loads
- Sum of vertical reactions = vertical loads
- Sum of moments about any point = applied moments

## Common Frame Types

**Portal Frame (1 bay, 1 story)**
- Simple rigid frame with two columns and one beam
- Common in industrial buildings

**Multi-Bay Frame (2-3 bays, 1 story)**
- Multiple portal frames connected
- Efficient for warehouses, parking structures

**Multi-Story Frame (1 bay, 2+ stories)**
- Vertical stacking of portal frames
- Common in building frames

## Tips

- Start with a single-bay, single-story frame to understand the results format
- Ensure member stiffnesses are realistic for your materials
- For steel: E ≈ 200 GPa, For concrete: E ≈ 25-30 GPa
- Check displacement limits against building codes

## Limitations (MVP)

The current implementation:
- Assumes all joints are rigid connections
- Uses small displacement theory (linear analysis)
- Does not include second-order (P-Δ) effects
- Loading interface is simplified (enhance in production version)

Future versions will support:
- Custom loading per member
- Sidesway/no-sidesway options
- Pinned connections
- Non-prismatic members
