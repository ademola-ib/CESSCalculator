## Beam Analysis Overview

The beam analysis module solves for reactions, shear force, bending moment, and deflection in single and multi-span beams using slope-deflection methods.

## Input Parameters

### Beam Properties

**Total Length (m)**
- The overall length of the beam from left to right
- Must be a positive number
- Example: 10.0 meters

**EI (kN·m²)**
- Flexural rigidity of the beam
- Product of Young's modulus (E) and moment of inertia (I)
- Must be positive
- Example: 50000 kN·m²

**Number of Spans**
- Select 1, 2, or 3 spans
- Multi-span beams have intermediate supports
- Continuous beams use slope-deflection compatibility

### Loading Conditions

**Load Type**
- **Point Load** - Concentrated force at a specific location
- **Uniformly Distributed Load (UDL)** - Constant load per unit length
- **Applied Moment** - Concentrated couple

**Load Magnitude**
- For point loads and UDL: Enter value in kN or kN/m
- For moments: Enter value in kN·m
- Can be positive (downward) or negative (upward for unusual cases)

**Load Position** (Point loads only)
- Distance from the left support in meters
- Must be within the beam length
- Example: For a 10m beam, position can range from 0 to 10

## Support Conditions

The MVP assumes:
- **Single span**: Simply supported (pinned-roller)
- **Multi-span**: Continuous beam with intermediate simple supports

Future versions will allow custom support configuration.

## Results Interpretation

### Support Reactions

Displayed in kN for each support. Verify that:
- Sum of vertical reactions equals total applied load
- Reactions are reasonable for the given loading

### Shear Force Diagram (SFD)

- Shows internal shear at each point along the beam
- Sudden jumps indicate point loads
- Slope indicates distributed load intensity
- Zero crossing points identify potential maximum moment locations

### Bending Moment Diagram (BMD)

- Shows internal moment at each point
- Maximum moment often occurs where shear is zero
- Sign convention: Positive bending creates tension at bottom fiber

### Deflection Diagram

- Shows vertical displacement along the beam
- Maximum deflection often at mid-span for simple beams
- Values in millimeters
- Check against code limits (L/360, L/240, etc.)

## Example Workflow

1. **Define Geometry**: Enter beam length (e.g., 8m) and EI (e.g., 40000 kN·m²)
2. **Specify Loading**: Add a point load (50 kN) at 4m (mid-span)
3. **Save Project**: Click "Save Project" to preserve your input
4. **View Results**: Switch to Results tab
5. **Verify**: Check that reactions sum to 50 kN and are symmetric
6. **Export**: Download PDF report of results and diagrams

## Tips

- For uniformly distributed loads, use the total load, not load per meter
- Check reactions sum to total applied vertical load for equilibrium
- Maximum moment for a simply supported beam with central point load is PL/4
