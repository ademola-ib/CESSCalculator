## Recommended Workflow

Follow this systematic approach for accurate and efficient structural analysis.

## 1. Problem Setup

**Define the Structure**
- Sketch the beam/frame on paper first
- Identify support types and locations
- Mark all loads with magnitudes and positions
- Note any special conditions (settlement, temperature, etc.)

**Gather Properties**
- Collect material properties (E values)
- Determine cross-section properties (I values)
- Calculate EI for each member
- Verify units are consistent

## 2. Create Project

**Start New Analysis**
1. From dashboard, select Beam or Frame analysis
2. Give the project a descriptive name
3. Choose the appropriate structural type

**Input Geometry**
- Enter dimensions carefully
- Double-check values before proceeding
- Use consistent units throughout (recommended: m, kN, kN·m²)

## 3. Define Loading

**Load Application**
- Add loads one at a time
- Verify load magnitudes and positions
- Consider load combinations if applicable
- Save after each major input step

**Load Cases**
- For MVP: Single load case per project
- Create duplicate projects for different load combinations
- Name projects clearly (e.g., "Beam_DL", "Beam_LL")

## 4. Run Analysis

**Execute Solver**
- Switch to Results tab to trigger analysis
- Review calculated reactions first
- Check equilibrium (reactions should equal loads)

**Initial Validation**
- Do reactions make sense?
- Are signs consistent with your sketch?
- Is symmetry preserved (if applicable)?

## 5. Interpret Results

**Diagrams Review**
- SFD: Check for expected jumps at point loads
- BMD: Verify zero moment at simply supported ends
- Deflection: Confirm maximum is at expected location

**Numerical Checks**
- Maximum values are reasonable
- Signs are correct (tension/compression)
- Displacements are within code limits

## 6. Documentation

**Export Results**
- Use PDF export for reports
- Include project name, date, and assumptions
- Attach diagrams and key values

**Project Archival**
- Rename project with final description
- Duplicate if you need variations
- Export data backup from Settings

## Best Practices

### Organization

- Use clear, descriptive project names
- Include load case in name (e.g., "Bridge_Beam_DL+LL")
- Create separate projects for parametric studies
- Regularly export backups

### Validation

- Hand-check simple cases before complex ones
- Compare with published solutions when available
- Verify equilibrium at every stage
- Check units meticulously

### Efficiency

- Duplicate projects instead of re-entering data
- Use History to quickly access recent work
- Save intermediate steps during complex analyses
- Export results promptly to avoid losing work

## Common Pitfalls

**Input Errors**
- Forgetting to save after changes
- Mixing units (kN with lbf, meters with feet)
- Incorrect sign convention
- Transposing dimensions

**Analysis Errors**
- Not checking equilibrium
- Ignoring warnings or unrealistic results
- Misinterpreting sign conventions
- Skipping validation steps

**Workflow Issues**
- Not saving frequently enough
- Poor project naming conventions
- Losing track of load combinations
- Forgetting to export final results

## Example: Complete Analysis

**Problem:** 8m simply supported beam, 40 kN point load at 3m from left, EI = 50000 kN·m²

1. **Setup**: Sketch beam with supports at x=0 and x=8, load at x=3
2. **Create**: New beam project, name "Example_8m_40kN"
3. **Input**: Length=8, EI=50000, load=40 kN at position=3
4. **Save**: Click Save Project
5. **Analyze**: Go to Results tab
6. **Verify**: R1 = 25 kN, R2 = 15 kN (sum = 40 kN ✓)
7. **Review**: Check max moment ≈ 75 kN·m at x=3
8. **Export**: Download PDF with diagrams
